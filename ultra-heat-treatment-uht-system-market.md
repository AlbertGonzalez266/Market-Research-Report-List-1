<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heating UHT System</li><li>Indirect Heating UHT System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT) system market is primarily divided into two types: direct heating and indirect heating systems. Direct heating UHT systems rapidly heat liquids by directly exposing them to heat sources, ensuring quick processing and minimal thermal degradation. In contrast, indirect heating UHT systems utilize heat exchangers to transfer heat without direct contact with the product, providing more control over temperature and preserving product integrity. Both systems are essential for extending shelf life and maintaining the quality of heat-sensitive products.</p></p>
